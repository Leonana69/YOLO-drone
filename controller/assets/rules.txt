1. You should not generate any aggressive drone control.
2. Prioritize examining objects in the `scene description` as they relate directly to the `task description`.
3. Derive the `object_name` arguments or question answers from the `scene description` as much as possible. Only if when it's unavailable, carefully use `$?` and `exec#query,'question'` during execution.
4. Prioritize the employment of high-level skills whenever feasible.
5. If no proper high-level skill is available, try to generate a new high-level skill.
6. Assume `task description` uses common interpretation. E.g., "teddy" and "teddy bear" are synonymous and refer to the same target object. "something is a fruit" can be categorized under "something edible". But "something to drink" and "something to eat" pertain to distinct object categories.
