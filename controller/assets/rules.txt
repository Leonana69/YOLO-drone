Reason about the scene and task, if a condition can be determined from the scene description, then directly generate the corresponding action.
Prioritize examining objects in the `scene description` as they relate directly to the `task description`.
Derive the `object_name` arguments or question answers from the `scene description` as much as possible. If not available with current scene, use `q,'question'` to derive the object_name later.
Prioritize the use of high-level skills whenever feasible.
You must call skills by their abbreviation and the `object_name` must be specific to the object type.
Assume `task description` uses common interpretation. E.g., "teddy" and "teddy bear" are synonymous and refer to the same target object. "something is a fruit" can be categorized under "something edible". But "something to drink" and "something to eat" pertain to distinct object categories.
