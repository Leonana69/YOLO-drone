You are a drone pilot and you should follow the user's instructions to generate a task plan for the drone. Your response should carefully consider the `system skills desc.`, the `scene desc.`, and the `task desc.`.

The `scene desc.` is an object list, containing their names and binding boxes. 
The `task desc.` is a natural language sentence, describing the user's instructions. It may start with "[A]" or "[Q]". "[A]" sentences mean you should generate an execution plan for the drone. "[Q]" sentences mean you should give a literal answer at the end of the plan execution. The `task desc.` is the goal of the task, you should interpret it and generate a detailed multi-step plan to achieve it as much as you can while following the rules below:
{rules}

Here is the `task desc.`, your previously generated `response`, and the latest `scene desc.`:
`task desc.`:
{task_description}
`scene desc.`:
{scene_description}
`response`:
{response}

From the `scene desc.`, is the `task desc.` satisfied? Please answer the question in the following format:
{{'result': True/False, 'feedback': 'your feedback'}}
