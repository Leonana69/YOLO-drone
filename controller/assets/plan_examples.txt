Example 1:
Scene: []
Task: [A] Find a bottle, tell me it's height and take a picture of it.
Response: ?s('bottle')==True{g('bottle',10);_2=oh('bottle');l(_2);tp}
Reason: no bottle instance in the scene, so we use scan to find bottle, then go and use object_height to get the height and log to output the height, finally use picture to take a picture of the bottle

Example 2:
Scene: [apple_5]
Task: [A] Find an apple.
Response: g('apple',10)
Reason: there is an apple instance in the scene, we just go to the apple_5

Example 3:
Scene: [apple_3]
Task: [Q] Is there an apple and an orange on your left?
Response: tu(90);?iv('apple')==True&iv('orange'){l('Yes');->True}l('No');->False
Reason: turn left 90 degrees, then use is_visible to check whether there is an apple on your left

Example 4:
Scene: [chair_13,laptop_2]
Task: [A] Go to the chair behind you.
Response: tc(180);g('chair',80)
Reason: the chair_13 is not the target because we want the one behind you. So we turn 180 degrees then go to the general object chair, since chair is a large object, we use 80cm as the distance.

Example 5:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_1,bottle_5]
Task: [A] Find and go any edible object.
Response: _1=sa('Any edible target here?');?_1!=False{g(_1,10)}
Reason: edible object is abstract and there is no edible object in the scene, so we use scan_abstract to find the edible object

Example 6:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_9]
Task: [A] Turn around with 30 degrees step until you can see some animal.
Response: 12{_1=p('Any animal target here?');?_1!=False{l(_1);->True}tc(30)}->False
Reason: we use loop and probe to find animal

Example 7:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_9]
Task: [A] If you can see a chair, go find a person, else go find an orange.
Response: _1=s('person');?_1==True{g('person',60);->True}->False
Reason: From the scene, we can see a chair, so we use scan to find a person. Since person is a large object, we use 60cm as the distance

Example 8:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_9]
Task: [A] Go to 
Response: l('Please give me more information.')
Reason: The task is too vague, so we use log to output the advice

Example 9:
Scene: [chair_1 x:0.58 y:0.5 width:0.43 height:0.7 color:gray, apple_1 x:0.6 y:0.3 width:0.08 height:0.09 color:red]
Task: [A] Turn around and go to the apple
Response: mu(40);g('apple',10)
Reason: after turning around, we will do replan. We found that the chair is blocking the apple, so we use moving_up to get over the chair and then go to the apple

Example 10:
Scene: [apple_1 x:0.34 y:0.3 width:0.09 height:0.1 color:red, apple_2 x:0.3 y:0.5 width:0.15 height:0.12 color:red]
Task: [A] Go to biggest apple
Response: g('apple_2',10)
Reason: from the scene, we tell directly that apple_2 is the biggest apple

Example 11:
Scene: [door_1 x:0.2 y:0.4 width:0.2 height: 0.2]
Task: [A] Go through the door
Response: g('door_1',40);mf(150)
Reason: Approach the door_1, then move forward to go through the door

Example 12:
Scene: []
Task: [A] Get to the next room
Response: s('door');g('door',40);mf(150)
Reason: Find the door_2, then move forward to go through the door
