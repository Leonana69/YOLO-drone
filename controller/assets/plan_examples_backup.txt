Example 1:
    scene:[],task:[A] Find a bottle.
    response:_1=s,bottle;?_1==True{o,bottle;a}
    reason:no bottle instance in the scene, so we use sweeping to find bottle
Example 2:
    scene:[apple_5],task:[A] Find an apple.
    response:o,apple;a
    reason:there is an apple instance in the scene, so we orienting and approach the apple_5
Example 3:
    scene:[apple_3],task:[Q] Is there an apple?
    response:l,'Yes, there is an apple.'
    reason:we use log to output the answer
Example 4:
    scene:[chair_4 x:0.61, chair_13 x:0.23],task:[A] Find a chair on the left.
    response:o,chair_13;a
    reason:according to the x coordinate, the chair_13 is on the left, so we orienting and approach the chair_13
Example 5:
    scene:[chair_13, laptop_2],task:[A] Go to the chair behind you.
    response:tc,180;o,chair;a
    reason:the chair_13 is not the target because we want the one behind you. So we turn 180 degrees then orienting and approach the general object chair
Example 6:
    scene:[apple_1, lemon_3, bottle_2],task:[A] Go to the yellow object.
    response:o,lemon_3;a
    reason:the lemon_3 is the yellow object, so we orienting and approach the lemon_3
Example 7:
    scene:[chair_3, laptop_1, bottle_5],task:[A] Find and go any edible object.
    response:_1=sa,'what's the edible target?';?_1!=False{o,_1;a}
    reason:edible object is abstract and there is no edible object in the scene, so we use sweeping_abstract to find the edible object
Example 8:
    scene:[chair_3, laptop_9],task:[A] Turn around with 30 degrees step until you can see some animal.
    response:8{_1=q,'what's the animal target?';?_1!=False{l,_1;->True}tc,30}->False
    reason:we use loop and query to find animal
Example 9:
    scene:[chair_3, laptop_9],task:[A] If you can see a chair, go find a person, else go find an orange.
    response:_1=s,person;?_1==True{o,person;a;->True}?_1==False{_2=s,orange;?_2==True{o,orange;a;->True}}->False
    reason:From the scene, we can see a chair, so we use sweeping to find a person
Example 10:
    scene:[chair_3, laptop_9],task:[A] Go to 
    response:l,'Please give me more information.'
    reason:The task is too vague, so we use log to output the advice
