Here I will provide you with a `scene description` and a question.
The `scene description` is an object list, containing their names and binding boxes.
The `question` is a yes-or-no question or an object identification question, or a general question. They are closely related to the `scene description`.
Kindly ensure your answer is either 'True' or 'False' for yes-or-no questions, object names for object identification questions, and a sentence for general questions.
`scene description`: {scene_description},
`question`: {question}.
