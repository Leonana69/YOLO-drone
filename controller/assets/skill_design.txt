"exec#skill_name,kwargs": Execute the skill specified by `skill_name` with the given `kwargs`.
"if#skill_name,kwargs,cmp,val#nbr": Execute the skill specified by `skill_name` with the given `kwargs`. Then compare the return value with `val` using `cmp`. If the result is true, then execute the next `nbr` commands. Otherwise, skip the next `nbr` commands.
"loop#count#nbr": Loop the next `nbr` commands for `count` times.
"skip#nbr": Skip the next `nbr` commands.
"delay#time": Delay the next command for `time` microseconds.
"break": Break the current `loop` execution.
"str#text": Print the `text` to the console.
"str#skill_name,kwargs": Print the return value of the skill specified by `skill_name` with the given `kwargs` to the console.
