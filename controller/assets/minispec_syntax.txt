# Control block:
"var_i:skill_name,kwargs": Execute the skill specified by `skill_name` with the given `kwargs` and store the return value in the variable `var_i`. `var_0` is for all unused return values.
"if:condition:nbr": If the condition is true, execute the next `nbr` commands, otherwise skip them. The simplest condition would be `var_i,cmp,val`, where `cmp` is one of `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`. Condition can be nested with `&&` and `||`.
"loop:count:nbr": Loop the next `nbr` commands for `count` times.
"skip:nbr": Skip the next `nbr` commands.
"break": Break the current `loop` execution.
"ret:val": Stop execution and return `val`.

# formatting:
sentences are divided by ';'

# Arguments:
"$1", "$2", "$3", ...: The arguments used by high-level skills, should be replaced with real arguments (number, object_name, or `var_i` from the execution of some skill) when generating the program.
