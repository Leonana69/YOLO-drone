# Control block:
"exec#skill_name,kwargs": Execute the skill specified by `skill_name` with the given `kwargs`.
"if#skill_name,kwargs,cmp,val#nbr": Execute the skill specified by `skill_name` with the given `kwargs`. Then compare the return value with `val` using `cmp`. If the result is true, then execute the next `nbr` commands. Otherwise, skip the next `nbr` commands.
"loop#count#nbr": Loop the next `nbr` commands for `count` times.
"skip#nbr": Skip the next `nbr` commands.
"delay#time": Delay the next command for `time` microseconds.
"break": Break the current `loop` execution.
"print#text": Print the `text` to the console.
"ret#val": Return `val` as the return value of the current skill.

# Arguments:
"$1", "$2", "$3", ...: The arguments used by high-level skills, should be replaced when generating the program. If the specific argument cannot be determined at planning time, you can use `$?` as a special placeholder which represents the result of the last `exec` skill execution. Make sure the use of '$?' is following following a `exec` skill.
